*On every second minute. Starting the first 2min with 6 thrusters, add two reps every second minute. 6-8-10-12-14…… No time cap.
It is ok to start on the thrusters before both athletes are in.
(If the running takes more than 60 seconds, increase the thrusters by one rep instead of two. Target for every team is to make at least 5 rounds.)
